3   Topological Sorting of Large Networks Topological Sorting is a procedure required for many problems involving analysis of networks.   An example of one such problem is PERT.  The present paper presents a very general method for obtaining  topological order.  It permits treatment of larger networks than can be handled on present procedures  and achieves this with greater efficiency.  Although the procedure can be adapted to any machine, it  is discussed in terms of the 7090.  A PERT network of 30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one  hour of machine time.  The method was developed as a byproduct of procedures needed by Westinghouse,  Baltimore.  It has not been programmed and at present there are no plans to implement it.  In regard  to the techniques described, Westinghouse's present and anticipated needs are completely served by the  Lockheed program, which is in current use. CACM November, 1962 Kahn, A. B.

10   An Optimal Insertion Algorithm for One-Sided Height-Balanced BInary Search Trees An algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced (OSHB) binary search tree is presented.  The algorithm operates in time  O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  This represents an improvement over the best previous ly known insertion algorithms of Hirschberg and Kosaraju, which require time O(log 2n).  Moreover, the O(log n) complexity is optimal. Earlier  results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also be performed in O(log n) time.  Thus the result of this paper gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time  complexity than insertion.  Furthermore, it can now be concluded that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for the more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor.  However, the insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees. CACM September, 1979 Raiha,K. Zweben, S.

18   A Programming System for the On-line Analysis of Biomedical Images A preliminary description of the software for a computer-display system is given with special emphasis on the  man-machine interaction. This  system is intended for a wide variety of biomedical applications. As an example, the methods are applied to the karyotyping of chromosomes.  The  system is separated into four programming tasks: picture transformations, file  maintenance, picture structuring, and display management.  Picture structuring is considered as the vehicle for man-machine communication. A prototype data format for pictures, called a picture-form, is developed. Structure operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce  new pictures-forms.  Many of the ideas are taken from the symbolic mathematical  laboratory at MIT conceived by Marvin Minsky.

20   A Microprogrammed Implementation of EULER on IBM System/360 Model 30 An experimental processing system for the algorithmic language EULER has been implemented in  microprogramming on an IBM System/360 Model 30 using a second Read-Only Storage unit.  The system consists  of a microprogrammed compiler and a microprogrammed String Language Interpreter, and of an I/O control  program written in 360 machine language.  The system is described and results are given in terms of microprogram  and main storage space required and compiler and interpreter performance obtained.  The role of microprogramming  is stressed, which opens a new dimension in the processing of interpretive code.  The structure and content  of a higher level language can be matched by an appropriate interpretive language which can be executed  efficiently by microprograms on existing computer hardware.

23   Wengert's Numerical Method for Partial Derivatives, Orbit Determination and Quasilinearization In a recent article in the Communications of the ACM, R. Wengert suggested a technique for  machine evaluation of the partial derivatives of a function given in analytical form.  In solving non-linear  boundary-value problems using quasilinearization many partial derivatives must be formed analytically  and then evaluated numerically.  Wengert's method appears very attractive from the programming viewpoint  equations which might not otherwise be undertaken. CACM April, 1965 Bellman, R. E. Kagiwada, H. Kalaba, R. E.

28   Considerations in the Design of a Multiple Computer System with Extended Core Storage The use of large quantities of addressable (but not executable) fast random access memory to  heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system is discussed.  The general design  of the hardware arrangement and the software components and functions of such a system are based on a  planned configuration of dual CDC 6600's that share one million words of extended core storage.  In the  generalization of such a design, special emphasis is placed on estimating expected gains when compared  with the traditional configuration of separate and independent computers without extended core storage.   An observation is made on the use of conventional, slower speed, random access storage devices in place  of the faster memory. CACM May, 1968 Fuchel, K.
